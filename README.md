# Data-logger

This project is a modular sensor data logger system designed to simulate real-world vehicle telemetry and visualize it in real-time.

It combines microcontrollers, CAN simulation, MQTT messaging, and cloud-style dashboards.

## What’s Inside?

| Component                  | Description                                                       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STM32 (Blue Pill)          | Reads accelerometer (ADXL345) data over I2C and sends it via UART |
| Raspberry Pi               | Acts as a gateway, reading UART or CAN and publishing to MQTT     |
| CAN HAT + Pi               | Simulates fake CAN messages (speed, RPM) for testing              |
| Node-RED + InfluxDB        | Visualizes real-time data and stores it in a time-series DB       |

## Features

- Live gauges for speed and RPM (CAN)
- Accelerometer data logger (STM32 → UART → MQTT)
- MQTT-based communication
- InfluxDB time-series storage
- Web-based dashboard (Node-RED)
